## Pin Pad challenge in Ruby

This is my approach for to solve following challenge: https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/2

Please run `bundle install` to install this project's gems.

Make sure the specs are working:

```
$ bundle exec rspec
```

In order to run the script please run:

```
$ bundle exec ruby bin/initiator.rb
```

You'll be prompted to select the keypad you want to validate (1 or 2).
Afterwards please enter your sequence either directly from the challenge, or alternatively, from the `input` file in the root folder. Please make sure to exit your input by entering `END` and hit enter.
