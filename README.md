## Pin Pad challenge in Ruby

This is my approach for to solve following challenge: https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/2

Please run `bundle install` in case you like to run specs via RSpec.

In order to run the script please run the `initiator.rb` file within the `lib` folder. Initially you'll be asked to choose one out of two keypad variants that are being used in the challenge. If you want to go with the challenge, enter 1.

Afterwards please enter your sequence either directly from the challenge, or alternatively, from the `input` file in the root folder. Please make sure to exit your input by entering `END` and hit enter.
